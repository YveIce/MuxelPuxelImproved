# MuxelPuxelImproved
Minecraft Mod for [MixelPixel.net](https://mixelpixel.net) Server.
*(This mod is created by fans of the server, not by the server owner/team.)*

**New Name:** This replaces my old mod "Yve-Topbar", because when i started this mod, i never planed to public release it. 
And the main goal was to only replace the ugly score by something better. With the new name, i hope it's much clearer what the mod is about.   

**Features:**
- replace the scoreboard (in most cases) with a nice topbar for a cleaner view
- customize topbar colors, show fps and realtime, hide money, ...
- Discord RPC (show everyone that you are currently playing minecraft on mixelpixel with details)
- custom loading-screen color
- get warning if your tool is next to breaking (it still will break, if you ignore the warning)
- disable horn-sounds
- hide tooltip on empty tooltip description (for ex. glaspanes used for the inventory menus)
- custom main-menu background
- more to come...
